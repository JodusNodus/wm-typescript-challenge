## User story

```
As a user
I can see the most popular cocktails
So I can get inspired on which cocktail to make
```

## ✅ Acceptance criteria

- I can see the 5 most popular cocktails

## 📝 Notes

- The mock api for popular currently returns all cocktails. **You need to alter this.** Since we are mocking something here, you can just assume that the first five from the `cocktails.json` are the most popular. Just slice the first 5 from the array.
